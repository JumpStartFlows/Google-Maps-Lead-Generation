# üîµ Google Maps Lead Generation

> **Automated AI-powered Lead Generation using Google Maps Data**

---

## üìå Brief Project Overview

This project leverages an automated workflow powered by **n8n** and **OpenAI GPT** to source, enrich, and categorize leads directly from Google Maps. It simplifies lead generation processes for businesses, significantly improving the efficiency and accuracy of identifying potential customers.

---

## üéØ Problem Statement

Traditional lead generation is often:

- Time-consuming and manual
- Error-prone due to inconsistent data handling
- Lacking intelligent categorization and prioritization

The objective was to automate this process using readily available data from Google Maps, enhanced by AI-powered categorization.
